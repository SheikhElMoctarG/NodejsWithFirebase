## Why is this Repository?
it is for the beginners to use firebase with nodejs(***Express***), it will help you to create first project connected with the Firebase if you want it.
# Important files NOT FOUND ON THE REPOSITORY.
I didn't all files on the repository because some files is private of my database and I cannt push it to public.

`.env`: it is file to save all API-KEYS and it is private FILE, **DONT PUSH IT ON THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY**.
### .env
```
API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
AUTH_DOMAIN = "xxxxxx.firebaseapp.com"
PROJECT_ID = "xxxxxx"
STORAGE_BUCKET = "xxxxxx.appspot.com"
SENDER = "XXXXXXX"
APP_ID = "X:XXXXXXXXXXX:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
MESUREMENTID = "G-xxxxxxxx"
``` 

`dataPrivateKey.json`: the firebase will take you the file to download to your project and it is PRIVATE FILE, **remember: DONT PUSH IT ON THE PUBLIC REPOSITORY**.
### dataPrivateKey.json
```
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "xxxxxx",
  "private_key_id": "xxxxxxx",
  "private_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_email": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "auth_uri": "XXXXXXXXX",
  "token_uri": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "XXXXXXXXX",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

Good luck to your code ❤️⭐
